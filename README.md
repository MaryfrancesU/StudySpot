# Study Spot
Millions of students around the world suffer from the same, terrible problem: not having a place to study! As they wander around campus in the futile search of a place to study, precious minutes that could have been spent finally understanding that one complicated Physics formula end up wasted. That’s where urstudyspot.com comes into play! Here to make studying as efficient as possible, Study Spot allows students to find study spots around campus and book them before they embark on their endeavor. 

Study Spot’s main database lists all available-to-book study spots on the U of R campus. 

Each spot will have various fields such as how social the location is, loudness level, distance from food places in case you want to grab a quick study snack, and many other attributes to cater to each student. To book a study spot, a user must first create an account and, upon viewing the spots available within the selected time frame, make their choice! There is a wide array of study spots for the student to choose from, from tables in Gleason to whole rooms in Douglass, the far-off reaches of the Stacks, and even the leisurely chairs on the Rush Rhees balcony. 

Studying is already unpleasant enough, urstudyspot.com is here to help. Studying has never been smoother!
